abstract = {The book deals with all four laws, the zeroth law and its application to temperature measurements. The first law of thermodynamics has large influence on so many applications around us, transport such as automotive, marine or aircrafts all rely on the steady flow energy equation which is a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics. The second law focuses on the irreversibilities of substances undergoing practical processes. It defines process efficiency and isentropic changes associated with frictional losses and thermal losses during the processes involved. Finally the Third law is briefly outlined and some practical interrepretation of it is discussed.},

abstract = {In this work, we aimed to study the effect of nanoparticles on the efficiency of dye-sensitiezed solar cells (DSSC) using polymer gel electrolytes (PGE) of PVDF-HFP/PVA blends. The concentration of polymer blend was fixed at 10 wt{\%} with ratios of 8:2. The TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles was varied at 0.25-2.0 wt{\%}. It was found that the efficiencies ($\eta$) of the cells using liquid electrolyte and PGE were 3.49±0.05{\%} and 3.26±0.09{\%}, respectively. While the efficiencies of DSSCs using nanocomposite electrolytes was considerably decreased. The best effeciency of DSSCs using PGE containing 0.25 wt{\%} TiO2 and 0.5 wt{\%} SiO2 were found to be 2.71±0.10{\%} and 3.03±0.09{\%}, respectively. This may be due to the higher viscosity of the nanocomposite gels and phase separations between nanoparticles and polymer matrices. Furthermore, the electrical resistances of electrolytes were investigated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The EIS showed that DSSC using ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) shows the lowest Rct2 and Rdiff, and the interfacial resistances. While the DSSC containing nanoparticles exhibits the higher Rct2 and Rdiff, corresponding to their DSSC efficiency. This result corresponding with their DSSCs effeciences. The functional groups of polymer gel electrolytes were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and the thermal properties of polymer gel electrolytes were analysis by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for applications in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).},

@article{Lennard-Jones1931,
abstract = {At the turn of the 19th century, it was generally believed that the great distance between earth and the stars would forever limit what could be learned about the universe. Apart from their approximate size and distance from earth, there seemed to be no hope of determining intensive properties of stars, such as temperature and composition. While this pessimistic attitude may seem quaint from a modern perspective, it should be remembered that all knowledge gained in these areas has been obtained by exploiting a scientific technique that did not exist 200 years ago—spectroscopy. In 1859, Kirchoff made a breakthrough discovery about the nearest star—our sun. It had been known for some time that a number of narrow dark lines are found when sunlight is bent through a prism. These absences had been studied systematically by Fraunhofer, who also noted that dark lines can be found in the spectrum of other stars; furthermore, many of these absences are found at the same wavelengths as those in the solar spectrum. By burning substances in the laboratory, Kirchoff was able to show that some of the features are due to the presence of sodium atoms in the solar atmosphere. For the first time, it had been demonstrated that an element found on our planet is not unique, but exists elsewhere in the universe. Perhaps most important, the field of modern spectroscopy was born. Armed with the empirical knowledge that each element in the periodic table has a characteristic spectrum, and that heating materials to a sufficiently high temperature disrupts all interatomic interactions, Bunsen and Kirchoff invented the spectroscope, an instrument that atomizes substances in a flame and then records their emission spectrum. Using this instrument, the elemental composition of several compounds and minerals were deduced by measuring the wavelength of radiation that they emit. In addition, this new science led to the discovery of elements, notably caesium and rubidium.},

@inproceedings{Kang2008,
abstract = {It is well known from 193nm simulation studies that accounting for the electromagnetic (EM) interaction between the incident light and the mask become more important as the mask geometry shrinks. In particular this transition occurs when the size of the mask pattern becomes comparable to the wavelength of light. Early simulation work in EUV lithography indicated rigorous EM calculations are required to predict the subtle effects associated with the mask absorber shadowing effect. These calculations generally show that non-normal mask incidence creates several problems, including HV-bias, slit position dependent bias, and slit position dependent pattern shift. These results are surprising because the mask sizes studied are much larger than the 13.5nm wavelength. If approximate methods could be used rather than the rigorous EM calculations then EUV simulations would be much faster and more accessible. In this study, rigorous EM simulation results are compared with a Kirchoff approximation. The results show that Kirchoff simulations can mimic the shadowing effect with a simple mask bias. It is also found that the pattern shift effect is an artifact caused by a misinterpretation of the rigorous simulation results. With proper biasing depending on the pattern orientation and field position, simple Kirchoff simulation can be used. Thus Any MBOPC tool currently available can handle EUV proximity correction with minor modifications. 1.},
